GeomorphTools
=============

Tools for creating topographic profiles and measuring the Earth. Geomorph Tools is a javascript-based graphing tool that will create a topographic profile for a transect that you create on a map. It also can report distance, area, slope, sinuosity.

The purpose of this tool is to allow geomorphology students to measure natural features from around the world. I've used it with students to measure the slope and sinuosity of different streams, to compare the height and width of waterfalls, to measure the width and depth of ocean trenches, and to explore and find exciting places from around the world.
